## Project Overview 
This project presents the implementation of a standard single-cycle MIPS CPU ,
designed and tested for the Altera DE10 FPGA board.
The CPU is designed using VHDL and integrates core MIPS features along with GPIO, 
Basic Timer and Interrupt Controller.

### CPU Peripherals
- GPIO : allows the CPU to interact with external devices(LEDS/SW...).

- Interrupt Controller : handles the prioritization and management of external interrupts,
  allowing the CPU to respond to events and execute the relevent interrupt servise routines.

- Basic Timer : A hardware timer component that generate time intervals for functions like PWM signal generation and periodic interrupts.
